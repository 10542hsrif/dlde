# Door Lightweight Desktop Environment (Debian Edition)

**This is a lightweight desktop environment that I use to my daily computing activities.**

You  may download this repository via GitHub to install the desktop environment. Just unzip the file and run to the terminal the following command:

```cd dlde/```

to move to the DLDE directory, and:

```sh install.sh```

Afterwards, answer the questions during installation. This may take a while. Be patient.

To install entirely from command line, type the following:

```git clone https://github.com/10542hsrif/dlde```

to clone from the `git` repo, then:

```cd dlde/```

to change directory of the installer, then:

```sh install.sh```

to start the installer. Answer the questions during installation. This may take a while. Be patient.
